# CPSC 5340 - Mobile Applications Development 2: 
# CPSC5340-FinalProject

# Assignment Instructions:

In this mobile application development series, we discussed Swift, Storyboards, UIKit and SwiftUI. We started off with building basic applications using Storyboard and UIKit, and refactored these apps using MVC pattern. We discussed navigation controllers and segues to build multi-view applications.

Then, we introduced SwiftUI, worked on implementing MVVM pattern, reading and decoding JSON, and writing data to Firebase Firestore. 

Now, as a final project, you will spend your time developing the application of your choice. It should be built on the material covered in CPSC5330 and this course CPSC5340. You may use things not covered in class, but you are advised not to "plan" an application that is too ambitious.

Requirements

1.  The application should do something useful and be of more complexity than the previous assignments. (200 points)

2. Make a video of you demoing your app. (100 points)

The video should be about 5-10 minutes and should cover,

Why you chose to do this app
How to use the app, including a demo
Discussion of how the app works, including any particular challenges you faced,  and
What would you change if you were to continue to work on the app.
